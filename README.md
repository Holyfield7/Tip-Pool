# Tip-Pool
Agentic Creator Tip &amp; Payout Router

TipPool is a lightweight agentic payments platform for content creators and small teams that collects on-chain tips on Cronos and automates distribution using AI agents and x402-compatible instruction flows. Creators set simple payout rules (split percentages, minimum payout thresholds, and cadence) and embed a Tip widget on their sites. When conditions are met, an AI agent evaluates the rules and triggers an on-chain distribution so creators and team members receive their share automatically — all visible and auditable on Cronos EVM.

TipPool demonstrates agentic payment automation (x402-style) in a real use case: pooling micropayments and distributing them securely with minimal trust assumptions. The prototype includes a Solidity TipPool contract deployed on Cronos Testnet, a React dashboard for creators, and a Node.js agent using the Crypto.com AI Agent SDK to observe events, evaluate intents, and execute payouts.
