**0:00 - 0:20 | Introduction**
(Show the Vercel Landing Page)
"Hi, I'm [Your Name]. This is Tip-Pool, an agentic payment router built for the Cronos Hackathon.
We noticed that content creators and teams struggle to manage micro-tips and payouts efficiently. 
Tip-Pool solves this by providing a unified specific 'Pool' where funds can be credited and instantly routed to team members wallet-to-wallet."

**0:20 - 1:10 | The API Demo**
(Switch to Postman or Terminal)
"Let me show you the live API running locally."

"First, I'm checking the live server health."
(Run GET /) -> "It's alive."

"Now, I'm creating a new user, 'Alice', and crediting her wallet with $100."
(Run POST /wallets/credit for Alice) -> "Success. Balance is $100."

"Now, Alice wants to tip Bob $25 instantly."
(Run POST /tips) -> "Transaction complete."

"If we check the database, we see the ledger is updated immediately."
(Show GET /wallets/alice -> $75)
(Show GET /wallets/bob -> $25)

**1:10 - 1:40 | The Architecture**
(Switch to GitHub README)
"The system is built with a high-performance PHP backend for off-chain speed. 
However, our roadmap includes the `TipPool.sol` smart contract (which is in our repo) to allow AI Agents to automate these payouts on the Cronos blockchain based on activity rules."

**1:40 - 2:00 | Conclusion**
(Switch back to Landing Page)
"Tip-Pool bridges the gap between fast web2 payments and web3 automation.
Thanks for watching!"
